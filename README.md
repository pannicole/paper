# Scribblez

## Intro

Welcome to Scribblez!

This code randomly generates a collection of standard shapes (circles, lines, etc) to create cartoon faces that look hand-drawn. The placement, shape, and size of the features are all randomized so each face is unique. You can save your favorite faces on your computer! This project is in conjunction with my NFT Scribblez Marketplace repo: https://github.com/pannicole/polygon-ethereum-nextjs-marketplace-1

## Run

This app is deployed with Heroku. Go to the below link to start generating faces!
